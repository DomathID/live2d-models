# Live2d model

Live2d models collected by individuals are generally extracted from games, most of which are mobile games. For Live2d mobile games, audio resources generally have encryption and decryption method sources and the Internet.


**note**


There is no guarantee that the configuration of the model is correct. If you cannot view it with Live2d Viewer, please check whether model.json (model3.json) is configured correctly.
Model configuration instructions can view the instructions written by me, for reference only
[Configuration Instructions](https://eikanya.github.io/post/live2d%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE/)


You can use Live2DViewerEX to edit the model to add voice or modify the model configuration.

My personal blog [blog](https://eikanya.github.io/) has moc3 models for testing live2d, as well as some related game Live2d models and audio extraction methods, because there are many tutorials on the moc model network, and the source code is also available. So just test the moc3 model.

The live2d tested on my blog is also based on the Internet, modified by myself, there are not many functions, and my own entertainment is fine. Pay attention to LICENSE, do not use it for commercial purposes.
